Business Forecasting
In today's competitive business landscape, maximizing profits is a top priority for every organization. With the help of data science professionals, businesses can leverage the power of data to make accurate predictions and drive strategic decision-making. By analyzing the data generated by a company, valuable insights can be gained regarding the future behavior of target customers
Business forecasting, including sales, revenue, and expenditure predictions, serves as a crucial tool for organizations to anticipate future trends and enhance their overall performance. 
By embracing predictive analytics, businesses can unlock new opportunities and stay ahead in the dynamic market environment.

Predicting Quarterly Sales Revenue of Adidas using #Python

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting the quarterly sales revenue of Adidas using time series analysis techniques. The goal is to understand the underlying patterns and trends in the data and provide accurate forecasts for future revenue.
To get started with this project, I followed these steps:

Step 1: Installing the Required Packages
To run the code successfully, I started by installing the necessary packages. I used the following command to install the required packages using pip

Step 2: Importing the Required Libraries
Before diving into the code, I imported the necessary libraries that will be used throughout the project

Step 3: Importing the Data
To perform the analysis, I imported the quarterly sales revenue data of Adidas. You can import your own dataset or use the provided dataset. 

Step 4: Visualizing the Data
I created a line plot to visualize the quarterly sales revenue data. This provides an overview of the trends and patterns in the data. 
- You can choose the plotting library that suits your preference.

Step 5: Determining the Model Type
To determine the appropriate model type (additive or multiplicative), I used the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. This test helps assess the stationarity of the time series data. 

Step 6: Decomposing the Time Series
To assess the seasonality in the data, I used the seasonal_decompose function from statsmodels. This function decomposes the time series into its underlying components: trend, seasonality, and residual

Step 7: Training the SARIMA Model
To train the SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model and make predictions, I used the SARIMAX class from statsmodels
- This will fit the SARIMA model to the data and provide a summary of the model's parameters and statistical metrics.

Step 8: Forecasting Future Revenue
To forecast the quarterly revenue for future periods, I used the get_forecast method of the fitted SARIMA model
- As expected, this will generate the predicted values for the specified number of steps into the future.

Step 9: Visualizing the Predictions
Finally, I added the predicted values to the initial plot to visualize the forecasted revenue alongside the actual data.
